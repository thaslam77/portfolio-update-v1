        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am an ongoing aspired web developer who loves to create things for the web. I've worked in various fields in computer science providing support in developement, testing, and maintence in the computer science field. 
          Bouncing around in different levels of support, I find myself wanting to grow in web development. I’m excited to expand my knowledge as a Frontend Developer, and learning these skills from Treehouse.</p>
        <p>I have also been a Disc Jockey for the past 15 years.  It's been such a great experience building a catalog of music and to be able to play to crowds of people. I love the process of discovering new music and finding a creative way to play them in my sets.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Even though my strong desires fall in a big pot of web development, my hobbies keep me busy.  I've listed a few below:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Music</li>
          <li>Movies</li>
          <li>Cars</li>
          <li>VR Gaming</li>
          <li>Traveling</li>
        </ul>
      </div> 

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites as a Frontend Developer. I would also like to increase my knowledge with backend technologies primarily in JavaScript to eventually become a Full-Stack Developer.  The skills listed below are my primary interests.</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
